                <p> My hobby is photography, I like taking photo's of trees and lakes. One of my favorite pictures that I've took is one of a snowy mountain. I find it quite easy to find the better angle, and look at the better scenery. I also feel satisfaction when I snap the picture and find out that I took a good picture. I take photo's from whenever I have a camera. Photography is a fun and satisfying activity. It's really easy as well! “Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving." From everything to finding the angle, and then hearing the snap, and then seeing the flash of light, photographs are a way of making memories. They capture how rich reality really is. </p>
